/*
 * Ideation for the BullsEyeGame Model
 *
 * Properties: current value, target value, round number, total score, minimum slider value, maximum slider value
 * Calculated Properties: difference between current and target value
 *
 * Actions: Calcualting point based on difference,
 *          Calculating bonus based on difference,
 *          reset game,
 *          pick random next value
 *

/*
 * Reson Behind Making BullsEyeGame a Class
 *
 * In this homework, I chose class instead of struct for the model
 * named BullsEyeGame. Because in BullsEyeGame I have multiple
 * mutable properties that will be changed multiple times
 * throughout the game. If I use struct here then I have to use
 * the mutating keyword before every method where the properties
 * will be changed. This will be verbose to read.
 *
 * Also, if I choose struct here, to change the property I have to
 * use var instead of let for the BullsEyeGame object as I have to
 * call mutating methods to change properties. var will allow me to
 * change the object itself. This might lead to a bug in the future.
 * Here I want the reference to be fixed after fist initialization and
 * I just want to change the properties of the object. In this scenario,
 * I think the class is a better choice.
 *

     * And only exposed the immutable variables. So that, any dev using this
     * API won't be able to mutate the property accidentally.
